Josiah's Ball Simulation Recreation
(and no do NOT delete _internal)
a recreation of that famous trend going all over tiktok
don't worry if it resets in the middle of a simulation, it's an error
Controls:
just sit there
rmb (right mouse button, if you're not a true gamer): reset manually
backslash (\, coders and windows users!): quit if you don't know about alt f4 or you're just lazy
